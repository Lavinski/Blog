I'm deeply passionate about building great software and empowering teams. I love the ability of being able to create something from nothing. To make peoples jobs and lives, better and more enjoyable through technology. I value good work culture because people and technology are intrinsically intertwined. I know having context is key for building great software and I try to always optimise for people. I believe technical excellence always aligns with the business objectives and I value and strive to be more authentic to share and discover real stories.

I spend my time teaching and learning principals and patterns like Domain Driven Design, CQRS (Command query responsibility segregation), Event Sourcing, Functional Programming and MicroServices.
