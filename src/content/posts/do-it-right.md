I love this quote and I think it really fits in with what I'm doing with this blog, and in my everyday life. Taking pride in your work is the only way to ensure that it's as good as it can be. Every day I like to feel that things are better than when I started. It's oftern the little things that count the most and here I have the opportunity to explain why.
