title: "John Carmack Keynote"

---

John Carmack's keynote this year was a fantastic talk about software engineering. Parts [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93GwwNLEBFg) and [four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PhArSujR_A) of the keynote touched on all the key hot topics including Code Quality, Functional Programming, Static Typing vs Dynamic Typing, Static Analysis and Garbage Collection. Defiantly worth watching if you're into professional development, and if not it's still worth watching.
