Getting started to React and want to get right to it? These are the links you're looking for.

### What you need!

First up you’ll need Node: http://nodejs.org.au/

You can get the React tooling here: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

Once you have React you’ll want Redux: https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux 

That’s all you need to get started!


### Browser Extensions

React Developer Tools, great for debugging state: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

Redux Developer Tools, amazing for debugging state and time travel debugging: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)

### Extra Resources

The how and why of React apps: https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-redux/ 

A random super simple example Redux app: https://github.com/tstringer/create-react-app-with-redux 


### Extra packages for better redux apps

If you need to make ajax calls this is the best was to do it: https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga 

For caching updates to speed things up: https://github.com/reactjs/reselect

Remove magic strings in actions and reducers: https://github.com/pauldijou/redux-act


Happy coding! :)
