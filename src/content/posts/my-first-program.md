While not actually the first program I wrote, it was definitely the first substantial and quite large.

I wrote it for a school project.

It was a game.

Object oriented code.

I was almost finished, playable.

Decided to add a reset level button.

Immediately found it was very hard to do.

Because of state.

My scene was filled with objects each containing their own state.

Which all had to be managed and "reset"

I knew it was possible, but there were too many variables to keep track of.

Even if I'd spent the time to find them, I could easily miss one.

In the end I just blew away the entire level object and rebuilt a new one.

Functional programming could have make this possible.
