I've been putting this post off for a while now because I try not to ... say negative things ... there is some great work being done on fsharp at the moment. From the outside I saw a lot of people saying now great it was.

It's not so great.

Language is alright but it has some pain points, tooling is dreadful though. Especially if you mix F# and C# projects.

just about all the F# pain points, async, libs, mixing proj types, vs, debugging. It's got a long way to go before it's anywhere like C#. The worst part is you can't even go all in on functions because the clr type system has limitations



Not really at this stage. Had to switch to vscode because vs would use high cpu and ram and run SUPER slow. But vscode (iodine) is still super young.

All things considered C# will probably have all the functional programming things before F# has all the tooling and fixes

vs code jumpy
