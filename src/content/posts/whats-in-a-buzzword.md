title: "What's in a Buzzword"

---

It's sometimes tempting to dismiss things as the next Fad or Buzzword. There's never enough time to learn everything and some things are genuinely bad but if you get into the habit of dismissing everything you're also going to miss a lot of good things.

Next time you see a new name or word that's buzzing, take the time to investigate what it's about and make your own choices. Names help us to convey our ideas. Terms like `Domain Driven Design` and [`Microservices`](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) hold with them a host of [implicit knowledge](https://blog.8thlight.com/craig-demyanovich/2014/07/09/pattern-language-of-thieves.html). Wrapping up a bunch of existing concepts and providing it to us a concise whole.

Don't feel bad because you don't know a word, everyone has to say [i don't know](https://blog.42floors.com/i-dont-know/) every once in a while.

So next time you see a new library, pattern or architecture take a deeper look. Who knows, you might just learn something.
